### Machine Learning : Performance Assessment

In order to evaluate the performance and quality of a used ML algorithm, we rely on multiple criteria used on the target and desired output . 

Below is a list of relevant criteria and metric that we included into the platform :


* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

* Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

* Confusion Matrix

* Area under the Curve (AUC)
