### Machine Learning : Algorithms


In machine learning, there is a  variety of machine learning techniques and algorithms that serve as an **engine** to transform data into **insightful and predicting object**. 


We put at your disposal some of the most famous algorithms : 

* Linear Regression 


* Decision Trees


* Random Forests


* Support Vector Machine (SVM)


* Neural Networks(coming soon)
