### Machine Learning : Features engineering


#### Defintion :



Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features (characteristics, properties, attributes) from raw data.[1] The motivation is to use these extra features to improve the quality of results from a machine learning process, compared with supplying only the raw data to the machine learning process.[Wikepedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering)
